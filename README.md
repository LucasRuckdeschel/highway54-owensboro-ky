# The Green around the Owensboro Speedway
## Owensboro, Kentucky

This map is a snapshot of the land alongside KY Highway 54, which cuts through my hometown of Owensboro and has been the epicenter for rapid development of the last fifteen years. I wanted to capture a high-resolution image of this area because it has been completely transformed in recent years and my efforts in this project represent a snapshot into the past for me, within which I can look back and picture what the scenery used to look like. I joke and call this area the Owensboro Speedway because traffic along Highway 54 and the Interstate 165 spur is always a challenge to contend with.
